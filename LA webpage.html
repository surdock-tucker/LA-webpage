<p style="text-align: left;">A Software Engineer is a person who uses engineering principles to produce a software
    product. A Software Engineer’s aim is to make high quality software that provides a service. According to the
    “fullstack academy” website, a website to earn certifications for programming, “there are two broad types of
    Software Engineers.” The two fields are application developers and system developers. These fields both require so
    much underlying information. How is it possible that a qualified Software Engineer can learn all this information?
    Software Engineers can learn all of this information because of basic building blocks taught in classes or bootcamps
    and learning from online resources and group collaboration.</p>
<p style="text-algin: left">For SE’s to be able to learn the basic building blocks, they need to learn this through some
    sort of learning platform. Most SE’s have either a two-year degree or a 4- year degree. However, most recently,
    companies have started to give out coding certificates for completing coding boot camps. The nerdwallet website has
    an article explaining what a coding boot camp is. They explain that coding boot camps are, “intensive, short-term
    training programs in information technology fields.” This new way of learning about computer science is obviously
    not going to be as deep as someone who has a 4-year degree. Nerdwallet also says that “those who graduated from
    bootcamps earned a median starting salary of $66,964.” The traditional and more in-depth way of becoming an SE is
    going to a university or college. People who complete coding bootcamps will not necessarily have the background in
    math nor an in-depth view of how computers work. The most popular coding boot camp Coding Dojo is a 14-week program
    that covers the high-level programming basics, moves onto web development fundamentals, then covers 3 different
    coding languages. So, these coding boot camps do not cover all the necessary underlying information. </p>
<p style="text-algin: left">A SE that has earned a 4-year degree is going to learn about math concepts, computer
    concepts, and engineering concepts. For example, Washington State University requires that SE majors complete a full
    language path (Java or C++). They also require the completion of the core math requirements plus additional math
    classes. It also requires the completion of Software Engineering courses, meant to teach about engineering concepts.
    WSU also makes sure that SE students learn about Data and Information Management, an example being the Big Data
    class. Obviously, this approach is going to give a more in-depth approach about software engineering and makes the
    SE more valuable. However, both ways are capable of teaching people to code. </p>
<p style="text-algin: left">Another way that computer science has begun to teach is through computer games. The article
    Computer Science Education for Primary and Lower Secondary School Students: Teaching the Concept of Automata
    conducted a study of 90 children who played a video game that taught about automata concepts. The study concluded
    that, “70% of the children were able to understand the concept after playing the video game.” This begs the
    question, since the success rate is pretty high, can game based learning be used to learn about computer science?
    The article Comparing Traditional Teaching and Game-Based Learning Using Teacher-Authored Games on Computer Science
    Education conducts a study that asks if game-based learning is more effective than traditional way, and a second
    question that if game-based learning is more engaging? According to the article, “it found that game-based learning
    was practically as effective and that it was more engaging than traditional methods.” </p>
<p style="text-algin: left">Another method of teaching Software Engineering is through doing. Doing projects that are
    made by a teacher can help SE’s gain knowledge and experience. Experience is the best way to learn anything because
    it requires hands-on effort and can come with surprises that one may not encounter in regular learning. Salespoint:
    A Java framework for teaching object-oriented software development states that students “need to develop a lot of
    complex skills” and that the best way is through “hands-on development experiences.” This article also argues that,
    “students gain valuable experience and technical as well as social skills for their later professional lives.” So,
    the best way to learn about the real-world SE duties is to learn through experience and doing. </p>
<p style="text-algin: left"> Even after all this information is learned, new problems in the SE world arise. How is a
    software engineer supposed to keep up with changes and advance the field into new territory? Through my own
    experience, a team of Software Engineers working on a project can learn from each other and work together to
    complete a task. The way that engineers can share solutions and work on projects simultaneously is through version
    control systems. The most popular software for this is GIT. GIT allows programmers to upload their solutions to a
    repository (file). They can also pull the updated file from the repo and work on it without disturbing other
    programmers' work. Working on projects with collaboration will help everyone in the group understand the principles
    of SE and provide experience. And as discussed earlier experience is the best way for a SE to learn.
    Other than group learning, there are online resources that people ask questions and receive help on. Stack Overflow
    describes themselves as “a question-and-answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers.” They also have
    gotten answers to over 50 billion questions that have been asked on their website. In my personal experience while
    learning about computer science, I visit this website every time I have a problem. It gives an example of similar
    work and helps me realize what I am doing wrong. Stack overflow not only has the public domain, but they also have a
    private domain for companies so that their ideas do not get leaked when asking questions. They have more than 5000
    visitors for the private domain each day. These numbers and the popularity alone more than suggest that SE learn
    from using online question and answer forums or websites.
</p>
<p style="text-algin: left"> There are more online resources than forums for computer science. Another type of an online
    resource is an information-based website with examples. GeeksforGeeks is a website that contains, “well written,
    well thought out and well explained computer science and programming articles.” These articles provide written
    explanations of computer science principles and graphical representations of them. This provides two ways that a
    programmer can learn from either pictures or words.
    YouTube is a creative video platform that allows users to share videos. This platform has tons of information about
    computer programming. Videos of step-by-step explanations can be found on there. YouTube also has lecture videos
    that have been posted from the past, and tutorials for different programming languages. This online resource is full
    of readily accessible and easily understood information.
</p>
<p style="text-algin: left"> Basic building blocks taught in classes or bootcamps and learning from online resources and
    group collaboration make it possible to learn about Software Engineering. Software engineering is tricky to learn
    about because there is so much information and there is always more to discover and create. Therefore, Software
    Engineers must use so many different resources to learn. When working on a project as an SE the programmer needs to
    be able to learn as they are doing projects. Software Engineers are always learning and will always be
    learning. </p>
